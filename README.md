# Gender Detection using Image Classification

## Objective
Develop a machine learning model to classify images into gender categories (Female and Male) using a dataset of images. The project involves preprocessing images, extracting features, and training a model to perform gender classification.

## Libraries and Tools
- **Python Libraries**: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib
- **Machine Learning Tools**: Scikit-Learn
- **Image Processing**: OpenCV (cv2)

## Steps Involved

### 1. Import Necessary Libraries
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations and array handling.
- **Pandas**: For data manipulation (though not explicitly used in the provided code).
- **Matplotlib**: For visualizations (though not explicitly used in the provided code).
- **OpenCV (cv2)**: For image processing tasks.

### 2. Dataset Preparation
- **Path Setup**: Define the directory containing the training images and the corresponding labels.
- **Classes**: Create a dictionary to map class names to numeric labels (0 for Female and 1 for Male).
- **Image Reading and Preprocessing**:
  - Iterate through each class directory.
  - Read images in grayscale.
  - Resize images to a fixed size (200x200 pixels).
  - Append images and their corresponding labels to lists.

### 3. Data Inspection
- Print the list of labels (`Y`) to confirm the correct labeling of images.
- Print a sample of image arrays (`X`) to verify the preprocessing steps.

### 4. Next Steps
- **Data Preparation**:
  - Convert the list of image arrays (`X`) to a NumPy array and normalize pixel values if needed.
  - Convert the list of labels (`Y`) to a NumPy array.
  - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
- **Model Training**:
  - Choose an appropriate machine learning model (e.g., Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machine, Convolutional Neural Network) for image classification.
  - Train the model using the training dataset.
- **Model Evaluation**:
  - Evaluate the model's performance on the testing dataset.
  - Use metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model.
- **Results Visualization**:
  - Visualize the model's predictions and performance metrics.

## Summary
The project involves developing a gender detection model by processing and classifying images into 'Female' or 'Male' categories. The initial steps include image loading, resizing, and label assignment. The next phases will focus on feature extraction, model training, and evaluation.
